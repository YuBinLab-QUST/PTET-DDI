## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.12.7 and the following libraries:

* rdkit==2024.3.6
* torch_geometric==2.3.1
* torch_scatter==2.1.2+pt24cu124
* numpy==1.26.4
* pandas==2.2.3
* torch==2.4.1+cu124

You can install these dependencies, for example, using pip:
```bash
pip install rdkit==2024.3.6 torch_geometric==2.3.1 torch_scatter==2.1.2+pt24cu124 numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.2.3 torch==2.4.1+cu124
